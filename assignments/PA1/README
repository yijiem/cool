README file for Programming Assignment 1
========================================

Your directory should now contain the following files:

 Makefile
 README
 atoi.cl -> [cool root]/assignments/PA1/atoi.cl
 stack.cl
 stack.test -> [cool root]/assignments/PA1/stack.test

	The Makefile contains targets for compiling and running your
	program, as well as handing it in.

	The README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to
	answer the questions at the end of this README file.
	Just edit this file.

	atoi.cl is an implementation in Cool of the string to integer
	conversion function known from the C language.

	stack.cl is the skeleton file which you should fill in with
	your program.

	stack.test is a short test input to the stack machine.


        The symlinked files (see "man ln") are that way to emphasize
        that they are read-only.


Instructions
------------

	To compile and run your program, type:

	% gmake test

        Try it now -- it should work, and print "Nothing implemented"
        (among a few other things).


        To simply compile your program, type

        % gmake compile


	Instructions for turning in the assignment will be posted on the
	course web page.

	GOOD LUCK!

Questions on PA1
----------------

1. Describe your implementation of the stack machine in a single short
   paragraph.


2. List 3 things that you like about the Cool programming language.
I like the type system and rule (the "comform to"). Clear and simple to follow.
The case expression is very powerful!


3. List 3 things you DON'T like about Cool.
Some syntax is weird.
Not very clear whether the object is pass-by-pointer|reference or pass-by-value.
No explicit constructor/destructor.
No return keyword.
It's weird that a class needs to inherit from IO class to be able to use its
methods. Why can't I create an IO object or have static methods?
No explicit include syntax. Making intra-file dependency hard to follow.
The Blocks syntax feels really redundant.
"Let" sucks...
No logical operator sucks...
Semicolon sucks...
